India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India's culture, 
is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats. 

In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, 
and Zoroastrianism became established on India's southern and western coasts.  
By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,  
and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.    
Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has 
made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.  
Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,
and rising levels of air pollution. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,
but technological changes were introduced, and ideas of education, modernity and the public life took root.  
Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains,  
eventually founding the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.
